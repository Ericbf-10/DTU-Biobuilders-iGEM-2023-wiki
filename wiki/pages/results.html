          <h2 id="validation-of-the-tmsgfp">Validation of the TMS(GFP)</h2>
          <p>The TMS(GFP) from A. Paul, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811002">BBa_K4811002</a>, was tested as the composite part <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811018">BBa_K4811018</a> in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), where the TMS is induced by IPTG. This construct was USER cloned into the high copy number pUC19 backbone for testing.
          A reporter, consisting of <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811005">BBa_K4811005</a> was USER cloned into the low copy number pACYC184 backbone. This has GFP under control of Ptet promoter, and therefore induced by anhydrotetracycline(aTc). It also has mCherry, under control of the pBAD promoter, meaning L-arabinose will induce mCherry transcription. The mCherry transcript has the RBS <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811000">BBa_K4811000</a> incorporated, meaning that translation of mCherry should be inhibited by the TMS(GFP).</p>
          <p>A schematic of the system to be tested can be seen in Figure 1.</p>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 1: GFP is induced by aTc, mCherry is induced by L-ara, and the TMS is induced by IPTG. The hypothesis is that the TMS is able to repress translation of mCherry, by binding to the RBS, and that GFP is able to bind to the TMS, releasing the mCherry RBS of the TMS, allowing translation to begin.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>First, the system was tested by induction with varying levels of L-arabinose and IPTG, to find the optimal induction conditions. The results of this can be seen below:</p>
          <p>As described in <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/dtu-denmark/engineering">Engineering</a>, 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-ara were found to be sufficient conditions for simultaneous expression of mCherry and the TMS. Using these conditions, GFP was induced by aTc, which showed the following (Figure 2, 3):</p>
          <figure>

All measurements were with 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-arabinose, except the controls. As controls there is a culture induced with only 1 mM IPTG (IPTG), one only induced by L-arabinose (L-ara), and one with no inducers present (uninduced).

          <p>The results showed that aTc induced GFP, with 0.5 &mu;M having the highest fluorescence. We would have expected 1 &mu;$M GFP to have even higher fluorescence, however it seems to be lower, but with a much higher standard deviation associated with the data.
          With respect to mCherry fluorescence, we were not able to recreate the results of A. Paul, and the only statistical significance was for the measurement of 1 &mu;M of aTc, which had higher fluorescence than the other measurements. However, the corresponding GFP fluorescence was lower for 1 &mu;M aTc than for 0.5 &mu;M aTc. This may be an experimental error associated with the 1 &mu;M aTc measurement. There is also no statistical significance between the 0 &mu;M aTc measurement and the L-ara control, with only L-ara as inducer, and no IPTG.</p>
          <h2 id="validation-of-new-tmss">Validation of new TMS&#39;s</h2>
          <p>Using existing aptamers from the litterature, new TMSs were constructed. This includes two manganese responsive TMSs and two theophylline responsive TMSs. They were characterized by as the composite parts <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811021">BBa_K4811021</a>(PT7-TMS(Mn1)-TT7),  <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811031">BBa_K4811031</a> (PT7-TMS(Mn2)-TT7), <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811022">BBa_K4811022</a>(PT7-TMS(Theo1)-TT7), and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811026">BBa_K4811026</a>(PT7-TMS(Theo2)-TT7) in <em>E. coli</em> BL21(DE3), where the TMS is induced by IPTG. The constructs were USER cloned into the high copy number pUC19 backbone for testing.
          A reporter, consisting of <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811003">BBa_K4811003</a> was USER cloned into the low copy number pACYC184 backbone. This has mCherry under control of the pBAD promoter, meaning L-arabinose will induce mCherry transcription. The mCherry transcript has the RBS <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811000">BBa_K4811000</a> incorporated, meaning that translation of mCherry should be inhibited by the TMS, if the inhibiting capabilities are conserved upon changing the D-loop.</p>
          <p>A general schematic of the system to be tested can be seen in Figure 4</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 4: mCherry is induced by L-ara, and the TMS is induced by IPTG. The hypothesis is, that the TMS is able to repress translation of mCherry, by binding to the RBS, and that the ligand is able to bind to the TMS aptamer in the D-loop, releasing the mCherry RBS of the TMS, allowing translation to begin.

          <p>Two theophylline TMSs were tested for mcherry fluorescence based on concentration of theophylline, and we achived the results displayed in Figure 5.</p>

          <p>The results showed a statistically significant decrease in mCherry fluorescence based on theophylline concentration for TMS(theo2), but no statistical significance for TMS(theo1), which had a much higher standard deviation associated with its results.</p>
          <p>Additionally, two manganese TMSs were tested, and the results can be seen in Figure 6.</p>

          <p>Although a decrease in mCherry fluorescence can be seen based on manganese concentration, the results are not as statistically significant as for TMS(Theo2).</p>
          <h2 id="validation-of-pfoa-tmss">Validation of PFOA TMS&#39;s</h2>
          <p>3 different PFOA aptamers were incorporated into the D-loop of the TMS&#39;s <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811024">TMS(PFOA1) - BBa_K4811024</a>, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811030">TMS(PFOA2) - BBa_K4811030</a>, and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811025">TMS(PFOA3) - BBa_K4811025</a>. These were tested in quadruplicates with varying concentration of PFOA to create the graph displayed in Figure 7.</p>

          <p>All PFOA TMSs showed a decrease in mCherry fluorescence based on PFOA concentration. As mentioned in <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/dtu-denmark/engineering">Engineering</a>, this was the opposite as the expected, leading us to revise the model for how the TMS functions with these specific aptamers. Assuming that the observed correlation between PFOA and fluorescence is based upon a change in the structure of the TMS, the model shown in Figure 8 would explain the observed results.</p>

          <h2 id="discussion-and-future-perspectives">Discussion and future perspectives</h2>
          <p>As mentioned in <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/dtu-denmark/engineering">Engineering</a>, although contrary to what was expected from the original TMS paper, all the TMS biobricks produced in this work show a ligand-dependent inhibition of protein translation. This suggests a need to revise the mechanistic model of how the TMS structures exert their function. Overall, the produced TMSs show a concentration-dependent inhibitory activity whose specificity is conferred by the inserted aptamer sequence. Assuming that the observed correlation between PFOA and fluorescence is based upon a change in the structure of the TMS, a stabilization of the most stable inhibitory structure would explain the observed results.</p>
          <figure>
            <div id="animation"></div>
            <figcaption>
              Revised mechanistic model based on the findings of this work. In this example, theophylline binds to its TMS onto the D-loop inserted aptamer, and after binding on the reporter mRNA, fluorescence is reduced.</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Although the creation of various ligand-responsive TMSs was generally successful, it is worth noting that these behave in contradiction compared to what was initially expected. This is when only taken the work by Paul <em>et al.</em> (2020) into account. Thus, this might signal that reproducibility is dependent on other factors, which might have had an influence on our experimental. setup. Some variables that could have had an influence are pH, solubilized ions, and change in surface tension. </p>
          <p><strong>Theophylline is a weak base</strong>, so both the medium and intracellular pH might exert a slight effect across the theophylline experiments. The increase in effectiveness of the second version of the TMS compared to the first might shed light on the role of the structural features to look for during the part design. The original aptamer sequence selected contained a stem that connects the aptamer RNA sequence to the translated mRNA. This stem has the functional role of transmitting the conformational change of the aptamer upon theophylline binding to the mRNA by changing the accessibility of the RBS cassette through a one-nucleotide slipping mechanism. Although this mechanism exerts a response <em>in vivo</em> on the native mRNA, its function in a TMS design is unknown, and could make the TMS structure less sensitive to the ligand binding. Furthermore, its removal during the designing of TMS(Theo2) is seen to increase its sensitivity.</p>
          <p><strong>Manganese is a solubilized ion</strong>, which would change the osmotic pressure. One factor to be considered is that, the original aptamer inserted in the TMS structure was taken as a biobrick from the iGEM registry (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K902074">BBa_K902074</a>), and this sequence is native of <em>E. coli</em>, where it controls the production of the efflux pump for the export of manganese ions themselves. Hence, the intracellular concentration levels of manganese will appear broad on a population level, not only making <em>E. coli</em> not the best organism to characterize this structures into, but also likely leading to an organism-dependent effectiveness of the two Mn TMSs.</p>
          <p><strong>PFOA changes the surface tension of water</strong>, which may lead to better shaking of the culture during induction. Furthermore, association of PFOA to the bacterial cell membrane has been suggested in the literature but not deeply investigated, and possible disruption of cell membranes or membrane-associated proteins might impose additional stress conditions that should be accounted for while designing experiments. </p>
          <p>All these factors could be explored to determine the mechanism of action of the TMS. Having said this, we managed to obtain a statistically significant, dose-dependant response for both theophylline TMSs, of which <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K481101">BBa_K4811011</a> shows the highest response, and two PFOA TMSs, with <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811030">BBa_K4811030</a> showing the highest response. Naturally, further experimental confirmation is needed before definite conclusions about the produced TMSs can be reached. Specifically, a deeper insight into the mechanistic action of TMSs is necessary, and could aid the design of more TMSs in the future.
          We therefore encourage future teams to work with the TMS system to elucidate the exact method of action, as there is potential for elucidation and we have seen a wide variablity between operators. For future experiments, the addition of rigorous negative controls might be advisable in order test the specificity of the system and to eliminate contributions of false positives. Further factors to be tested might include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>toxicity of the selected ligands</li>
          <li>toxicity of reporter production-associated stress</li>
          <li>expression of efflux pumps</li>
          <li>culturing conditions</li>
          <li>strain-dependency of the system</li>
          <li>functionality in other types of organisms</li>
          <li>effect of ligand-associated conformational change on TMS-mRNA interactions</li>
          <li>re-design of the aptamer insertion area onto the TMS body</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We strongly believe that with the contribution and validation of the scientific community, this technology can become a valuable tool for the designing of various biosensors, as well as a bioengineering tool for the study of gene function.</p>
