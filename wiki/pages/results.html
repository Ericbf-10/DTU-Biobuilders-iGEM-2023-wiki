          <h2 id="validation-of-the-tmsgfp">Validation of the TMS(GFP)</h2>
          <p>The TMS(GFP) from A. Paul, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811002">BBa_K4811002</a>, was tested as the composite part <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811018">BBa_K4811018</a> in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), where the TMS is induced by IPTG. This construct was USER cloned into the high copy number pUC19 backbone for testing.
          A reporter, consisting of <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811005">BBa_K4811005</a> was USER cloned into the low copy number pACYC184 backbone. This has GFP under control of Ptet promoter, and therefore induced by anhydrotetracycline(aTc). It also has mCherry, under control of the pBAD promoter, meaning L-arabinose will induce mCherry transcription. The mCherry transcript has the RBS <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811000">BBa_K4811000</a> incorporated, meaning that translation of mCherry should be inhibited by the TMS(GFP).</p>
          <p>A schematic of the system to be tested can be seen in Figure 1.</p>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 1: GFP is induced by aTc, mCherry is induced by L-ara, and the TMS is induced by IPTG. The hypothesis is that the TMS is able to repress translation of mCherry, by binding to the RBS, and that GFP is able to bind to the TMS, releasing the mCherry RBS of the TMS, allowing translation to begin.
            </figcaption>

          <p>First, the system was tested by induction with varying levels of L-arabinose and IPTG, to find the optimal induction conditions. The results of this can be seen below:</p>
          <p>As described in <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/dtu-denmark/engineering">Engineering</a>, 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-ara were found to be sufficient conditions for simultaneous expression of mCherry and the TMS. Using these conditions, GFP was induced by aTc, which showed the following (Figure 2, 3):</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 2: OD normalized relative GFP fluorescence, 488 nm excitation/545 nm emission, as a function of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) concentration. All measurements were with 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-arabinose, except the controls. As controls there is a culture induced with only 1 mM IPTG (IPTG), one only induced by L-arabinose (L-ara), and one with no inducers present (uninduced).

            <figcaption>Figure 3: OD normalized relative mCherry fluorescence, 561 nm excitation/617 nm emission, as a function of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) concentration. All measurements were with 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-arabinose, except the controls. As controls there is a culture induced with only 1 mM IPTG (IPTG), one only induced by L-arabinose (L-ara), and one with no inducers present (uninduced).

          <p>The results showed that aTc induced GFP, with 0.5 &mu;M having the highest fluorescence. We would have expected 1 &mu;$M GFP to have even higher fluorescence, however it seems to be lower, but with a much higher standard deviation associated with the data.
          With respect to mCherry fluorescence, we were not able to recreate the results of A. Paul, and the only statistical significance was for the measurement of 1 &mu;M of aTc, which had higher fluorescence than the other measurements. However, the corresponding GFP fluorescence was lower for 1 &mu;M aTc than for 0.5 &mu;M aTc. This may be an experimental error associated with the 1 &mu;M aTc measurement. There is also no statistical significance between the 0 &mu;M aTc measurement and the L-ara control, with only L-ara as inducer, and no IPTG.</p>
          <h2 id="validation-of-new-tmss">Validation of new TMS&#39;s</h2>
          <p>Using existing aptamers from the litterature, new TMSs were constructed. This includes two manganese responsive TMSs and two theophylline responsive TMSs. They were characterized by as the composite parts <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811021">BBa_K4811021</a>(PT7-TMS(Mn1)-TT7),  <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811031">BBa_K4811031</a> (PT7-TMS(Mn2)-TT7), <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811022">BBa_K4811022</a>(PT7-TMS(Theo1)-TT7), and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811026">BBa_K4811026</a>(PT7-TMS(Theo2)-TT7) in <em>E. coli</em> BL21(DE3), where the TMS is induced by IPTG. The constructs were USER cloned into the high copy number pUC19 backbone for testing.
          A reporter, consisting of <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811003">BBa_K4811003</a> was USER cloned into the low copy number pACYC184 backbone. This has mCherry under control of the pBAD promoter, meaning L-arabinose will induce mCherry transcription. The mCherry transcript has the RBS <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811000">BBa_K4811000</a> incorporated, meaning that translation of mCherry should be inhibited by the TMS, if the inhibiting capabilities are conserved upon changing the D-loop.</p>
          <p>A general schematic of the system to be tested can be seen in Figure 4</p>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 4: mCherry is induced by L-ara, and the TMS is induced by IPTG. The hypothesis is, that the TMS is able to repress translation of mCherry, by binding to the RBS, and that the ligand is able to bind to the TMS aptamer in the D-loop, releasing the mCherry RBS of the TMS, allowing translation to begin.

          </figure>
          <p>Two theophylline TMSs were tested for mcherry fluorescence based on concentration of theophylline, and we achived the results displayed in Figure 5.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 5: OD normalized relative mCherry fluorescence, 561 nm excitation/617 nm emission, as a function of theophylline concentration. All measurements were with 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-arabinose.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The results showed a statistically significant decrease in mCherry fluorescence based on theophylline concentration for TMS(theo2), but no statistical significance for TMS(theo1), which had a much higher standard deviation associated with its results.</p>
          <p>Additionally, two manganese TMSs were tested, and the results can be seen in Figure 6.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Although a decrease in mCherry fluorescence can be seen based on manganese concentration, the results are not as statistically significant as for TMS(Theo2).</p>
          <h2 id="validation-of-pfoa-tmss">Validation of PFOA TMS&#39;s</h2>
          <p>3 different PFOA aptamers were incorporated into the D-loop of the TMS&#39;s <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811024">TMS(PFOA1) - BBa_K4811024</a>, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811030">TMS(PFOA2) - BBa_K4811030</a>, and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811025">TMS(PFOA3) - BBa_K4811025</a>. These were tested in quadruplicates with varying concentration of PFOA to create the graph displayed in Figure 7.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 7: OD normalized relative mCherry fluorescence, 561 nm excitation/617 nm emission, as a function of PFOA concentration. All measurements were with 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 % w/v L-arabinose.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>All PFOA TMSs showed a decrease in mCherry fluorescence based on PFOA concentration. As mentioned in <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/dtu-denmark/engineering">Engineering</a>, this was the opposite as the expected, leading us to revise the model for how the TMS functions with these specific aptamers. Assuming that the observed correlation between PFOA and fluorescence is based upon a change in the structure of the TMS, the model shown in Figure 8 would explain the observed results.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 8:The results showed PFOA concentration leading to a lower fluorescence. The model shown here would explain these results, with the TMS binding to the RBS <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4811000">BBa_K4811000</a> in presence of PFOA.
